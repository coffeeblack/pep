Changes from Pep 0.3 to Pep 0.4
===============================

 * Generalized the parsing algorithm to cover grammars that contain rules that
   have a mix of terminals and nonterminals on the right side. This involved
   
   - changing EarleyParser's scan() method and updating ParserListener with a
     modified hook edgeScanned();
   - changing Edge, Chart, the test files, and adding the ntmix.xml grammar;
   - modifying the behavior of the option PREDICT_FOR_PRETERMINALS: this option
     can be overridden if the grammar contains a rule with a right-hand side
     that contains both terminals and nonterminals;
   - changing the format of the grammar specification files to allow categories
     that contain a right side with a mix of terminals and nonterminals.

 * Adopted Apache's commons-cli library for parsing command-line options.
 
 * Added several convenience methods to Edge, ParseTree, Chart, and
   EarleyParser.
